    <h1>Apple 2020 Concepts</h1>
    <img src="images/og__fodnljjkwl6y.png" alt="Apple corporation logo">
    <p>We're a few months away from the launch of the 2020 iPhones, which are 
       expected in September or October 2020, but there are already dozens of rumors about 
       the upcoming devices. We're expecting the 2020 iPhones to be called the iPhone 12 
       and iPhone 12 Pro if Apple follows the same naming scheme it used for the 2019 iPhone lineup.

    <p>The 2020 iPhones will feature major updates, introducing some of the first 
      design changes that we've seen since the 
      <a href='https://www.apple.com/ru/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/'>iPhone X </a>
       was released in 2017. We're expecting four iPhones in three display sizes which could come in at
       <ul>
         <li>5.4</li>
         <li>6.7</li>
         <li>6.1 inches (x2)</li>
       </ul> </p>
      
    <p>Rumors suggest the 6.7-inch iPhone and one 6.1-inch model will be higher-end devices 
      with triple-lens cameras, while the 5.4 and 6.1-inch models will be lower-end iPhones 
      with dual-lens cameras and a more affordable price tag. All iPhones in 2020 are expected 
      to feature OLED display technology regardless of price, and a 120Hz "ProMotion" refresh rate 
      could be included in some of the higher-end models, though that's not guaranteed due to battery life 
      constraints and Apple could wait until 2021 to add the feature.</p>
